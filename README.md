# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Deployed @ https://its-jefe.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

This is [project #6][1] for [UCF Coding Bootcamp][2]

---

Uses the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) along with the [OpenWeather Current Weather Data API][https://openweathermap.org/current] to retrieve weather data for cities. 

## Usage
- Users may enter a city into the search field and hit search. They are then able to view the current conditions and 5-day forecast for that city.
- The searched cities are saved in a list and can be revisted.
- If the city is typed incorrectly or is not found in the database, an alert window will show and inform the user. 

## Implementing 
- `JavaScript`, `CSS`, `HTML`
- 2 OpenWeather `APIs`
- `localstorage`
- Error handling
